// // Which of the following is NOT correct for 
// // virtual function in c++?

// a. Must be declared in the public section of the class (T)
// b. Virtual function should be accesed using pointer (T)
// c. vfs are defined in base class (T)
// d. Virtual function can be static (F)

// there is no point of having a virtual function as static
// as the whole objective of a virtual function is to have polymorphic
// (which involves instantiation of class ~ no point of being static).
